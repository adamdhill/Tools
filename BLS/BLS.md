*Introduction*



Why Do People Cooperate? 

Motivations 
6 from Stalans

As ways to implement these motivations, use the Decoy Effect, Coherence, etc. 

basically blending motivations from psychology with decision making techniques from behavioral econ 






Prosocial behavior 
Theory

STANDARD TOOLS: WIENER2009


STRUCTURE: IDENTIFY WHAT TACTIC SURVEYS ARE CURRENTLY USING, THEN USE TYLER2010 TO IDENTIFY WHAT MOTIVATIONS IT MIGHT NOT BE LEVERAGE, OR OVER-LEVERAGING -- E.G., IDENTIFY SOME SOCIAL MOTIVATIONS THAT COULD BE APPLICABLE, THEN SHOW HOW TO TEST THEM

Use the methods in:

Stalans2012
Schwarz2013 - "IKEA effect", etc. 


*IKEA Effect*

IKEA effect might work particulary well = exempt from OSHA reporting requirements - more work 
Individuals tend to over-value itesm they possess, create, or design
Key, i guess, is getting them to started...

*Arbitrary coherence*

 

*Decoy Effect and Menu Effects*


*Peak-End Rule* - p 167, Angner

2. ORS - Occupational requirements survey

OES - occupational employment survey

ATUS - american time use survey

Sensitivity to Negative Consequences 



Civic Duty Principle


Scarcity Principle

Legitimate Authority Principle 

cf. why people obey the law

How to motivate cooperation in work settings (Frey and Osterloh 2002)

Cognition v motivation
Judgment and decision making literature - how people use their subjective knowledge of the world to make decisions - assumes material wealth key
Social psychology, however, teaches: motivation is also important 

Re motivations
Self-interest 
Incentive and sanctions
Social motivations

Mandated behaviors typically instrumentally motivated (p. 26) -- ADH: so perhaps downplay mandatoriness? 

*Types of cooperative behavior*
Compliance
In-role
Deference
Extra-role
Rule adherence + required = Compliance (26) 

*Motivational models*
Instrumental - people interact to exchange material resources 
Social - attitudes, values, identity, procedural justice, and motive-based trust

Idea: how can these five motivations explain cooperation?
