#Background

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

Motivation concerns why we make decisions
Cognition focuses on how we make those decisions
basically blending motivations from psychology with decision making techniques from behavioral econ 

Cognition v motivation
Judgment and decision making literature - how people use their subjective knowledge of the world to make decisions - assumes material wealth key
Social psychology, however, teaches: motivation is also important 

Re motivations
Self-interest 
Incentive and sanctions
Social motivations

Mandated behaviors typically instrumentally motivated (p. 26) -- ADH: so perhaps downplay mandatoriness? 


#Theories of Pro-Social Behavior and Cooperation 

Recent research on pro-social behavior moves toward unifying two previously competing schools of thought. 

Economic models have long assumed that individual motivation derives from self-interest, in the sense that motivation is caused by individuals' own desires or utility functions. Any given individual's utility function is independent is every other utility function. This assumption implies that desires are not affected by other individuals' desires; more strongly still, it implies that motivation stems from a desire for one's own satisfaction. Put differently, effects positive or negative on others are merely externalities; and any positive externalities ought to be internalized through compensation. [@Gauthier1986] Put more plainly, the rational choice model of motivation assumes that, if there is a conflict between what will satisfy me and what will satisfy others, I will prioritize my own satisfaction. 




Researchers broadly identify two types of motivation for cooperative behavior: self-interested and social. [@Tyler2010, pp. 11-26] Traditionally, economic models treated self-interest, as measured by material gains and losses, as the primary driver of all behavior, including cooperative behavior. [@cite, pp. ]  


"When the magnitude of the influence of instrumental and social motivations are directly compared, social motivations are found to explain more of the variance in cooperation than can be explained by instrumental motivations." [@Tyler2010, p. 13] 


Instrumental is important. Social is, too. And the two can interact.

*Types of cooperative behavior*

Compliance

In-role

Deference

Extra-role

Rule adherence + required = Compliance (26) 


#From general theory to Specific Motivations

Motivational models

Instrumental - people interact to exchange material resources 

Social - attitudes, values, identity, procedural justice, and motive-based trust

PJ and Scarcity go together

For PJ, SOII selection is fair (also for SOII, scarcity) 

If non-SOII, move up a level of abstraction -- not the process in which firms are chosen, but the way in which this survey is chosen, or way in which the classification of firm is chosen


From Stalans2012 (which is a mix of instrumental and social) 
 
Reciprocity Principle (I)

Sensitivity to Negative Consequences (I)

Civic Duty Principle (S)

Scarcity Principle (I)

Consistency Principle (I)

Legitimate Authority Principle (S) 


#Implementing Specific Motivations

How people use their subjective knowledge of the world to make decisions. 

Kahneman and Tversky [p 15 Tyler2010]

As ways to implement these motivations, use the Decoy Effect, Coherence, etc. 

*IKEA Effect*

IKEA effect might work particulary well = exempt from OSHA reporting requirements - more work 
Individuals tend to over-value itesm they possess, create, or design
Key, i guess, is getting them to started...

*Arbitrary coherence*

 

*Decoy Effect and Menu Effects*


*Peak-End Rule* - p 167, Angner


How to motivate cooperation in work settings (Frey and Osterloh 2002)

*Compared to standard ways of gaining compliance* 

STANDARD TOOLS: WIENER2009




*As Applied*

1. SOII

2. ORS - Occupational requirements survey

OES - occupational employment survey

ATUS - american time use survey
