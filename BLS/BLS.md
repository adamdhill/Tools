Prosocial behavior 
Theory


STRUCTURE: IDENTIFY WHAT TACTIC SURVEYS ARE CURRENTLY USING, THEN USE TYLER2010 TO IDENTIFY WHAT MOTIVATIONS IT MIGHT NOT BE LEVERAGE, OR OVER-LEVERAGING -- E.G., IDENTIFY SOME SOCIAL MOTIVATIONS THAT COULD BE APPLICABLE, THEN SHOW HOW TO TEST THEM

Priming Prosocial Behavior

How to motivate cooperation in work settings (Frey and Osterloh 2002)

Cognition v motivation
Judgment and decision making literature - how people use their subjective knowledge of the world to make decisions - assumes material wealth key
Social psychology, however, teaches: motivation is also important 

Re motivations
Self-interest 
Incentive and sanctions
Social motivations

Mandated behaviors typically instrumentally motivated (p. 26) -- ADH: so perhaps downplay mandatoriness? 

*Types of cooperative behavior*
Compliance
In-role
Deference
Extra-role
Rule adherence + required = Compliance (26) 

*Motivational models*
Instrumental - people interact to exchange material resources 
Social - attitudes, values, identity, procedural justice, and motive-based trust

Idea: how can these five motivations explain cooperation?
