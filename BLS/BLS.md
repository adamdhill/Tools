INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

basically blending motivations from psychology with decision making techniques from behavioral econ 

Cognition v motivation
Judgment and decision making literature - how people use their subjective knowledge of the world to make decisions - assumes material wealth key
Social psychology, however, teaches: motivation is also important 

Re motivations
Self-interest 
Incentive and sanctions
Social motivations

Mandated behaviors typically instrumentally motivated (p. 26) -- ADH: so perhaps downplay mandatoriness? 


*Theories of Pro-Social Behavior* 

Researchers broadly identify two types of motivation for cooperative behavior: instrumental and social. Tyler2010

Instrumental is important. Social is, too. And the two can interact.

*Types of cooperative behavior*

Compliance

In-role

Deference

Extra-role

Rule adherence + required = Compliance (26) 


*Specific Motivations*

Motivational models

Instrumental - people interact to exchange material resources 

Social - attitudes, values, identity, procedural justice, and motive-based trust

PJ and Scarcity go together

For PJ, SOII selection is fair (also for SOII, scarcity) 

If non-SOII, move up a level of abstraction -- not the process in which firms are chosen, but the way in which this survey is chosen, or way in which the classification of firm is chosen


From Stalans2012 (which is a mix of instrumental and social) 
 
Reciprocity Principle (I)

Sensitivity to Negative Consequences (I)

Civic Duty Principle (S)

Scarcity Principle (I)

Consistency Principle (I)

Legitimate Authority Principle (S) 


*Priming Prosocial Behavior*

As ways to implement these motivations, use the Decoy Effect, Coherence, etc. 

*IKEA Effect*

IKEA effect might work particulary well = exempt from OSHA reporting requirements - more work 
Individuals tend to over-value itesm they possess, create, or design
Key, i guess, is getting them to started...

*Arbitrary coherence*

 

*Decoy Effect and Menu Effects*


*Peak-End Rule* - p 167, Angner

*As Applied*

1. SOII

2. ORS - Occupational requirements survey

OES - occupational employment survey
