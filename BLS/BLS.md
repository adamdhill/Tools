INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

basically blending motivations from psychology with decision making techniques from behavioral econ 

Cognition v motivation
Judgment and decision making literature - how people use their subjective knowledge of the world to make decisions - assumes material wealth key
Social psychology, however, teaches: motivation is also important 

Re motivations
Self-interest 
Incentive and sanctions
Social motivations

Mandated behaviors typically instrumentally motivated (p. 26) -- ADH: so perhaps downplay mandatoriness?

From Stalans2012
 
Reciprocity Principle

Sensitivity to Negative Consequences 

Civic Duty Principle

Scarcity Principle 

Consistency Principle 

Legitimate Authority Principle 


*Priming Prosocial Behavior*

As ways to implement these motivations, use the Decoy Effect, Coherence, etc. 

*IKEA Effect*

IKEA effect might work particulary well = exempt from OSHA reporting requirements - more work 
Individuals tend to over-value itesm they possess, create, or design
Key, i guess, is getting them to started...

*Arbitrary coherence*

 

*Decoy Effect and Menu Effects*


*Peak-End Rule* - p 167, Angner
